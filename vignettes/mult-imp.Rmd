```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```
First we load the package:
```{r setup}
library(mavis)
```
## Datasets included in `mavis`
`mavis` comes with three datasets, `ups`, `yeast`, and `ramus` published in @berg2019evaluation and @ramus2016benchmarking (details can be found there).
All three datasets are quantified either with Progenesis or MaxQuant @tyanova2016maxquant.
The `ups` and `ramus` data sets are global proteomics dataset without reducing peptides to proteins with either *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* (chlamy; `ups`) peptides or *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (`ramus`) at the same concentration in all samples.
The `ups` is spiked-in with three different concentrations of the Universal Proteomics Standard Set 1 (UPS1) with four replicates each.
`ramus` dataset has nine different spike-in concentrations of UPS1 with three repliactes each.
The `yeast` data was generated by extracting reversibly oxidized cysteines in *S. cerevisiae* or chlamy where the yeast extraction was added in two different concentrations and chlamy in the same in all samples.
The yeast data is therefore a lot noisier than the `ups` and `ramus` data.
The yeast data looks as follows:
```{r, yeast}
yeast_prog
yeast_max
```
where the `identifier` is a column that uniquely maps each cysteine to the observations in `ng50_*` or `ng100_*` (which are the relative concentrations the yeast cysteines were spiked in with) and the integer at the end indicates different repeated experiments.
The ups data looks as follows:
```{r, ups}
ups_prog
ups_max
```
where the `identifier` is as in the yeast dataset but uniquely maps peptides and `fmol25_*`, `fmol50_*`, and `fmol100_*` are different relative concentrations of UPS1 with different technical replicates.
The `ramus` data looks as follows:
```{r, ramus}
ramus_prog
ramus_max
```
where the `identifier` is as in the yeast dataset but uniquely maps peptides and `[a-i]_*`, are 0.05, 0.125, 0.250, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 12.5, 25.0 50.0 fmol/Î¼g yeast lysate spike-ins of UPS1 with  with increasing spike-in by alphabetic order.

## Data normalization
The first step is to normalize the data.
The function `plot_norm_box` generates boxplots of the raw data after log$_{2}$ transformation and two different normalization methods. If we first look at the yeast data, then the plot can be generated as follows:
```{r norm_vis_yeast, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_norm_box(yeast_prog, 'identifier')
```
The data is already has a stable median, but we still do normalization.
This can either be done `tmm` as introduced in @robinson2010scaling or with `psrn` as introduced in @anders2010differential.
To exemplify we use `psrn` and `tmm` as follows:
```{r, yeast_prnn}
yeast_psrn <- psrn(yeast_prog, 'identifier')
yeast_tmm <- tmm(yeast_prog)
```
Both `psrn` and `tmm` first normalizes the data and then log$_{2}$ transforms it unless the flag `log=FALSE` is used.
For the `ups` data we do the same thing:
```{r norm_vis_ups, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_norm_box(ups_prog, 'identifier')
```
we might notice that the x-axis labels are overlapping.
Since `plot_norm_box` returns a `ggplot` object, one can easily rotate the label by using the `+` syntax and `ggplot2::theme` as follows:
```{r norm_vis_ups_ang, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_norm_box(ups_prog, 'identifier') +
  ggplot2::theme(
    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 15)
  )
```
in this way, any theme of the plot can easily be modified using `ggplot2` syntax.
One could also use the `plot_target` feature of `plot_norm_box` to select only a subset of samples to plot:
```{r norm_vis_ups_sub, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_norm_box(ups_prog, 'identifier', plot_target = contains('fmol25'))
```
which supports the `tidyselect` package operations for selecting columns.
Likewise, `tmm` and `psrn` have the flag `target` which can be used to select only a subset of columns to normalize.
If left unspecified they will use all numerical columns in the normalization!
They also contain the flag `load_info` which then makes the functions return a list with the normalized data, the estimated loading concentrations, and the estimated normalization factors used.
We then normalize the `ups` the same way as the `yeast`:
```{r, ups_prnn}
ups_psrn <- psrn(ups_prog, 'identifier')
ups_tmm <- tmm(ups_prog)
```

## Gamma regression for imputation and mean-variance normalization
From here on out, several functions in `mavis` will depend on a design matrix.
A design matrix can be created as follows:
```{r, design}
yeast_design <- model.matrix(
  #Yeast has two conditions (1:2) and three replicates (each = 3)
  ~0+factor(rep(1:2, each = 3))
)
ups_design <- model.matrix(
  #ups has three conditions (1:3) and four replicates (each = 4)
  ~0+factor(rep(1:3, each = 4))
)
#The design matrices has to have the same name as the conditions:
colnames(yeast_design) <- paste0('ng', c(50, 100))
colnames(ups_design) <- paste0('fmol', c(25, 50, 100))
```
The gamma regression and mean-variance scatter plots can then be produced by `plot_gamma_regression`.
`plot_gamma_regression` plots the trends used for precision weights (later fed to `limma`'s `lmFit` similar to `voom`; @law2014voom) on the left and gamma regression after trend partitioning on right.
For `yeast`:
```{r, gam_yeast, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_gamma_regression(yeast_psrn, yeast_design, verbose = FALSE)
```
and for `ups`:
```{r, gam_ups, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_gamma_regression(ups_psrn, ups_design, verbose = FALSE)
```
The two individual plots can be generated similarly by calling `plot_gamma` or `plot_gamma_partition`.
If one wants to inspect the estimated models that can be done similarly with `fit_gamma_regression`.

## Data imputation and significance calling
### Multiple imputation
To perform multiple imputations and then run limma on each imputation can efficiently be performed by `multiple_imputation_and_limma`.
`run_pipeline` fits the needed gamma regressions and has a backend to `multidplyr` for parallel processing.
This can drastically increase the speed when running 1000 or more imputations.
Here is an example of the `yeast` data running 1000 imputations and using 5 parallel workers.
First, we need to generate a contrast matrix that indicates what comparisons to perform.
```{r, yeast_contras}
yeast_contrast <- limma::makeContrasts(
  contrasts = 'ng100-ng50',
  levels = yeast_design
)
```
This performs the test if the mean of the cysteines in the `ng100` conditions is different from the means in the `ng50` condition.
Further, it also means that the LFC will be calculated as `ng100 - ng50`.
We are now ready to run the imputation.
```{r, yeast_pipeline}
yeast_multi_imputation_results <- multiple_imputation_and_limma(
  data = yeast_psrn,
  design = yeast_design,
  contrast_matrix = yeast_contrast,
  imputations = 20,
  workers = 1,
  id_col = 'identifier',
  plot_trend = FALSE, # we have already looked at the mean-variance plots
                      # otherwise, putting this flag to TRUE would generate those plots
  formula_imputation = sd ~ mean + c, # Use the partitioned data for imputation
                                      # c is the name of the column containing the partitions
  verbose = FALSE # No need to print the partitioning again
)
```
`yeast_multi_imputation_results` will now be a `tibble` with each row containing one imputation and one decision from limma.
```{r, yeast_results}
yeast_multi_imputation_results
```
If one wants to access one particular imputation or decision that can be done with `$` and `[[` as follows.
```{r, yeast_example}
yeast_multi_imputation_results$imputed_data[[5]]
yeast_multi_imputation_results$limma_results[[5]]
```
which shows the results of the fifth imputation.
Next to perform p-value correction and binomial testing for the imputations we use `extract_results`.
```{r, yeast_extract}
yeast_reduced_results <- extract_results(
  data = yeast_psrn,
  results = yeast_multi_imputation_results,
  id_col = 'identifier',
  alpha = 0.05,
  abs_lfc = 1,
  pcor = 'fdr',
  null_hyp = 0.5
)
```

### Single imputation
To perform a single imputation one can use the `single_imputation` function.
First we fit the gamma regression to estimate the variance for the imputation model then we perform the imputation:
```{r, yeast_sing_imp}
yeast_psrn <- yeast_psrn %>% 
  # Add mean-variance trends
  calculate_mean_sd_trends(yeast_design)
gam_reg <- fit_gamma_regression(yeast_psrn, sd ~ mean)
yeast_one_imputation <- single_imputation(yeast_psrn, yeast_design, gam_reg)
```
Next, we fit the gamma regression for estimating the precision weights with `fit_gamma_weights`.
```{r, yeast_gam}
yeast_gam_reg <- yeast_one_imputation %>% 
  # Update mean-variance post imputation
  calculate_mean_sd_trends(yeast_design) %>% 
  # Fit the regression
  fit_gamma_regression(sd ~ mean)
```
We now run a single instance of `limma` with `run_limma`.
```{r, yeast_limma}
yeast_one_imputation_results <- run_limma(
  yeast_one_imputation,
  yeast_design, 
  yeast_contrast, 
  yeast_gam_reg, 
  'identifier'
)
```
One might want to perform some p-value correction on this data.
This can be one with `R`'s function `p.adjust`.
Further, since `run_limma` returns the data in tidy format and if there are several comparisons, `dplyr`'s `group_by` and `mutate` can perform p-value correction per comparison as follows:
```{r, yeast_adjust}
yeast_one_imputation_results <- yeast_one_imputation_results %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(comparison) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    p_val = p.adjust(p_val, 'fdr')
  )
```

## Plotting the results
### Multiple imputation
The final decision for the analysis can be plotted with `plot_ma`.
`plot_ma` returns a `ggplot` object so it can easily be ascetically adjusted using `ggplot` syntax.
```{r, yeast_mult_ma, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_ma(yeast_reduced_results) + # Move legend to below the plot
  ggplot2::theme(
    legend.position = 'bottom'
  )
```


### Single imputation
For the single imputation, we need to include a few more inputs to `plot_ma`.
```{r, yeast_one_ma, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
plot_ma(
  hits = yeast_one_imputation_results,
  data = yeast_one_imputation,
  id_col = 'identifier',
  alpha = .05,
  abs_lfc = 0.5
) + # Set color-blind friendly colors
  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(
    values = c('grey45', 'darkblue', 'darkred')
  )
```
