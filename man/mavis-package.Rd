\title{mavis: Mean-Variance Modeling In Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics}
\description{
Mavis is a new package for label-free quanfication proteomics data analysis. Mavis is completely data-driven from the observed quantifications and can be applied to any post-quantification data set. Mavis can perform both imputation and statistical decisions. For imputation, Mavis produces a more robust estimator of the variance component of the missing data by using the M-V trend. Then, for the statistical testing for mean differences, Mavis makes inferences on the individual data points using the M-V trend. This, can either be used with the Baldur framework or the limma framework.
